    "## Installing package\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see two _very_ common recommendations:\n",
    "    \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install <package>         # Use only in virtual environment!\n",
    "pip install --user <package>  # Never use\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't use them unless you know exactly what you are doing! The first one will try to install globally, and if you don't have permission, will install to your user site packages (as of a recent pip update). In global site packages, you can get conflicting verions of libraries, you can't tell what you've installed for what, it's a mess. And user site packages are worse, because all installs of Python on your computer share it, so you might override and break things you didn't intend to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution depends on what you are doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safe libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "There are likely a few libraries that you just have to install globally. Go ahead, but be careful (and always use your system package manager instead if you can, like `brew` on macOS or the Windows ones - Linux package managers tend to be too old to use for Python libraries).\n",

    "If you are installing an \"application\", that is, it has a script end-point and you don't expect to import it, use pipx. It will isolate it in a virtual environment, but hide all that for you, and then you'll just have an application you can use with no global/user side effects!\n",

If you like this, `pipenv`, which was taken over by `PyPA` has a `Pipfile` and a `Pipfile.lock` which do exactly this, and combines the features of a virtual environment and pip. You can look into it off-line, but we are moving on. We'll encounter this idea again."
