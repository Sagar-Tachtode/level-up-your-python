    "This was a major new feature in Python 3.10. It looks a lot like a switch statement from C, but it's a lot more powerful. Many other modern languages have this too, like Ruby. If you can write Python 3.10 only things, then this can simplify code that would have had lots of `elif`'s and `isinstance` checks."

But like other new features, it is _more restrictive_, making it easier to _read_, _comprehend_, and reason about. It specifies that you are trying to match a single variable, while chained ifs could be doing anything, so a reader must check every if to see if the same variable is being used, etc."
