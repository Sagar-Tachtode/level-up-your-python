    "> Aside: This is not at all how you'd normally call this, but this is useful later when reasoning about how other features work, and for a sneaky trick: _any object_ can be passed in, not just an instance of the class (was not true in Python 2). In this case, the object simply needs to have a `.msg` attribute to be used in `Simple.function`. If you are tempted to write a library that provides both free functions and methods to do the same thing, this means they can be one and the same, avoiding duplication for you and learning two APIs for your users."
