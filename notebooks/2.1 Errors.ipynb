    "# Errors and catching them\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of errors in Python. A few really bad errors are segfaults. These are almost always something triggered via the C interface (such as by using `ctypes`), and are not due to problems in your Python code. _Most_ errors in Python are part of the language, called Exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Exception is just a special control flow feature for things that are \"exceptional\"; often errors, but they are used for other things. In fact, internally, loops end by triggering a special exception!\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions \"bubble up\" through the stack to the outermost scope. If you catch an exception before it reaches the top, you can handle it. If you don't, then it shows up on the screen or in your logs as a traceback."
