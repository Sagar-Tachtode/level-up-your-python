Website here: <https://henryiii.github.io/level-up-your-python>

Live (binder) instance here: <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/henryiii/level-up-your-python/master?urlpath=lab/tree/0%20Intro.ipynb>

This project comes with a conda environment file. To install, run:

```bash
conda create env
```

Then you can just start up a jupyter lab server:

```bash
juptyer lab
```

You only need to have [conda installed](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). If you want to have it pre-configured with [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), that's [available here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge). The Mambaforge version is _FAST_!
